# Edgenuity-Master-Controller-v0.4
Edgenuity Master Controller v0.4. Disclaimer: NOT MY CODE, JUST GOT THE OG CODE, BECAUSE THEY ARE TAKING THE CODE DOWN FROM MANY SITES.

Step 1: Install Tampermonkey at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo

Step 2: Take the Code From the Script file and copy it to your clipboard, aka CTRL + C.

Step 3: Go back to Chrome or whatever browser you are usingâ€”left click on tampermonkey and go to add new script or Create new script.
(NOTE: If you can't see the tampermonkey extension, then look for a puzzle piece and click it. Then you should see tampermonkey: If you click the thumbtack next to it, then you should be able to see it on your extension bar.)

Step 4: Remove any code/notes on the page that popped up. Make sure the console is clear/clean with nothing on it.

Step 5: Paste the code that you copied from step two.

Step 6: Click file in the top left corner of the console. Then hit save, (DO NOT DO SAVE TO DISK).

Step 7: It will bring you to another page. Now make sure that the script, called Edgenuity-Master-Controller-v0.4 or whatever name you picked for it, is enabled.

Step 8: Open Edgenuity and click the tampermonkey extension to make sure it is enabled If it is, just start working and it will start auto-clicking next.
