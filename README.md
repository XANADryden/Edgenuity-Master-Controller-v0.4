# Edgenuity-Master-Controller-v0.4
Edgenuity Master Controller v0.4. Disclaimer: NOT MY CODE, JUST GOT THE OG CODE, BECAUSE THEY ARE TAKING THE CODE DOWN FROM MANY SITES.

Step 1: Install Tampermonkey at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo

Step 2: Go back to Chrome or whatever browser you are using, left click on tampermonkey and click create new script.
(NOTE: If you can't see the tampermonkey extension, then look for a puzzle piece and click it. Then you should see a drop-down with tampermonkey: If you want, you can click the thumbtack next to it, which will pin tampermonkey to your extension bar for quick access.  On Firefox, you may need to find a double arrow instead.)

Step 3: Remove any code/notes on the tampermonkey page that popped up. 

Step 4: Copy the code from the Script file to your clipboard, aka CTRL + C.

Step 5: Paste the code that you copied from step four into the tampermonkey script page.

Step 6: Select file, then hit save. (DO NOT SAVE TO DISK)

Step 7: It will bring you to another page. Now make sure that the script, which should be called Edgenuity-Master-Controller-v0.4, is enabled.

Step 8: Open Edgenuity and click the tampermonkey extension to make sure it is enabled.

# Features
This extension will automatically press next, and will skip most of the otherwise unskippable instructions.
